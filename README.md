# Project 6

This project is a portfolio of all the projects I've done so far

### Technologies
* Express
* Pug
* Node

In this project, I create a gorgeous portfolio site to showcase the great projects I've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where I share contact info, share my elevator pitch and talk a little about myself, and a series of project pages  and detail my first five projects from this Techdegree.

I created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I've created.

I used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

I use Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project

I also made three css changes to my site. My "learn more" button turn blue when hover over. I added a picture collage about my life and I also added the program logo that's sponsoring me.
